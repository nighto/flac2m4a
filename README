flac2m4a is a shell script to convert FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) files to M4A (MPEG-4 Advanced Audio Codec) format.

You can use it to convert a single .flac file to .m4a, like

 flac2mp4 file.flac

Additionally, you can embed a gif, jpeg or png file as a cover-art, like

 flac2mp4 file.flac cover.png

flac2m4a takes only one flac file as parameter (i.e. converts only one file per time). You can, however, convert all files in a given directory using a bash loop:

 for i in *flac ; do flac2m4a "$i" cover.png ; done

A easy way to install on Linux is making it executable and copying it to a directory in your path, like

 chmod +x flac2mp4 && sudo cp flac2mp4 /usr/local/bin

flac2m4a uses flac and faac to decode/encode the audio files. On Ubuntu, you can install them with

 sudo apt-get install flac faac

Enjoy.
